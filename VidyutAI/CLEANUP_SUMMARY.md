# Dashboard Cleanup & Solar Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 Changes Completed

### ✅ 1. Removed Station Data Section
**Location**: "Your Company" page
**What was removed**:
- Detailed charging stations overview table
- Station selector dropdown
- Individual station details with metrics
- Component tabs (Batteries, Inverters, Solar Panels)
- Station-level battery, inverter, and solar panel status tables
- Battery SOC charts per station

**Result**: Cleaner, more focused company dashboard without excessive detail

### ✅ 2. Removed Grid Cost Page
**What was removed**:
- Complete "Grid Cost" page from navigation
- Grid Cost Analysis header and content
- 24-hour grid price history chart
- Grid load and renewable percentage metrics  
- Cost comparison table between grid and companies

**Navigation Update**: Menu now shows only:
- Market Overview
- Your Company  
- Renewable Market
- Profit Forecast
- System Settings

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Solar Generation (250 → 300)
**File Modified**: `energy_prediction_service.py`
**Change**: Line 297 - Updated multiplication factor
```python
# Before:
predictions_kw = (predictions_upscaled / 1000.0) * 250

# After: 
predictions_kw = (predictions_upscaled / 1000.0) * 300
```

**Impact**: 20% increase in solar generation capacity
