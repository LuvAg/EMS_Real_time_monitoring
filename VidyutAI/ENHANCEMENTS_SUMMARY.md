**Code Location:** `energy_prediction_service.py` line 297
```python
predictions_kw = (predictions_upscaled / 1000.0) * 250  # Scale factor of 250 as requested
```

### 3. Rule-Based Battery Management

#### Core Algorithm (`_manage_battery_storage`)
Implemented intelligent battery management based on time-of-day and energy balance:

**Time-Based Rules:**
- **Peak Hours (18-21):** Emergency discharge if SOC > 30%
- **High Solar (10-15):** Store surplus energy, charge up to 90% SOC
- **Night Hours (22-03):** Maintain minimum 25% charge
- **Pre-Peak (16-17):** Discharge if SOC > 60%
- **Default:** Maintain optimal 40-85% SOC range

**Safety Features:**
- Minimum SOC threshold: 20%
- Maximum charge rate: 15% of battery capacity
- Maintenance-required batteries skipped
- Temperature and voltage monitoring

#### Battery Status Tracking (`get_company_battery_status`)
Comprehensive battery analytics per company:
- **Total capacity and stored energy**
- **Average State of Charge (SOC)**
- **Real-time charging/discharging power**
- **Station-by-station breakdown**
- **Individual battery status monitoring**

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Visualizations

#### New Battery Overview Section
Added to "Your Company" dashboard page:
- **5-column metrics display:** Capacity, Stored Energy, Average SOC, Charging Power, Discharging Power
- **Color-coded SOC indicators:** Green (>50%), Red (<50%)
- **Real-time power flow visualization**

#### Battery Status Charts
- **Dual-chart visualization:**
  - Top: Capacity vs Stored Energy by station
  - Bottom: SOC percentage with color coding (Red <20%, Orange <50%, Green ≥50%)
- **Interactive Plotly charts** with hover information
- **Station-level battery breakdown**

### 5. System Integration

#### Enhanced Energy Balance Calculation
- **Battery contribution integration:** Discharging adds to available energy
- **Battery consumption tracking:** Charging reduces available energy
- **Net battery power calculation:** Positive = discharging to grid
- **Profit calculations include battery costs**

#### Hybrid Algorithm Support
- **RL Algorithm Path:** Battery management → Energy balance → RL trading decisions
- **Rule-Based Path:** Battery management → Energy balance → Rule-based trading
- **Consistent battery management** regardless of algorithm choice
